# Simple-Python-File-Coder
This is the simple file coder/decoder

I'm using Python3 and build in functions.

When programm start you need to choose a mode (c - code or d - decode)

# CODE
1. Enter what password you use to code file
2. Enter file name with extension

# DECODE
1. simple as CODE but DECODE
